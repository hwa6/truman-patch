## Spring 2022 Semester Patch

# Description

I was tasked with bridging the gap between several independent branches of the Truman platform. The targeted repositories were:

https://github.com/kgoebel124/trumancopy -- Admin Project \
https://github.com/RyanSchmidLehigh/Truman -- Hashtag+User Projects \
https://github.com/jfeng2542/Truman -- HashTag+User Extension Project

# Results

The Admin project was succesfully merged with the Hashtag+User project. The extension project made changes that broke the admin capability, and was not implemented.

# Future Developers

The Admin project used an outdated image set to display its icons. This needs to be fixed. The extension project makes distinct changes to the overall script and comments out seemingly crucial segments of code. I would start there.

# Useful Documentation

Using the linked repos, I meticulously trawled through their commit history, imlementing and testing each commit before moving to the next. If it is unclear what changes were made from the repo's, I would refer to the README sections of each one, as they lay out their respective progress and features used.

# Truman Platform

The Truman Platform is a fake social network for real results. This fake social network application allows researchers to create interesting and believable scenarios in a social network environment. Since the interactions that take place in a social setting and influence the outcome of an experiment, all content, users, interactions and notifications are “fake” and created by a set of digital actors. Each participant sees the same interactions and conversations, believe these to be unique to them.

This allows any experiment to be completely replicated, and the tools can be repurposed for other studies.

This current iteration is testing the bystander effect on cyberbullying. Future studies could be done on a number of other topics and issues.

This project and software development was supported by the National Science Foundation through IIS-1405634. Special thanks to everyone at Cornell Social Media Lab in the Department of Communication.

Also special thanks to Sahat Yalkabov and his [Hackathon Starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) project, which provided the basic organization for this project.
